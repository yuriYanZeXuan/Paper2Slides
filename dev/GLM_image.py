prompt = "A beautifully designed modern food magazine style dessert recipe illustration, themed around a raspberry mousse cake. The overall layout is clean and bright, divided into four main areas: the top left features a bold black title 'Raspberry Mousse Cake Recipe Guide', with a soft-lit close-up photo of the finished cake on the right, showcasing a light pink cake adorned with fresh raspberries and mint leaves; the bottom left contains an ingredient list section, titled 'Ingredients' in a simple font, listing 'Flour 150g', 'Eggs 3', 'Sugar 120g', 'Raspberry puree 200g', 'Gelatin sheets 10g', 'Whipping cream 300ml', and 'Fresh raspberries', each accompanied by minimalist line icons (like a flour bag, eggs, sugar jar, etc.); the bottom right displays four equally sized step boxes, each containing high-definition macro photos and corresponding instructions, arranged from top to bottom as follows: Step 1 shows a whisk whipping white foam (with the instruction 'Whip egg whites to stiff peaks'), Step 2 shows a red-and-white mixture being folded with a spatula (with the instruction 'Gently fold in the puree and batter'), Step 3 shows pink liquid being poured into a round mold (with the instruction 'Pour into mold and chill for 4 hours'), Step 4 shows the finished cake decorated with raspberries and mint leaves (with the instruction 'Decorate with raspberries and mint'); a light brown information bar runs along the bottom edge, with icons on the left representing 'Preparation time: 30 minutes', 'Cooking time: 20 minutes', and 'Servings: 8'. The overall color scheme is dominated by creamy white and light pink, with a subtle paper texture in the background, featuring compact and orderly text and image layout with clear information hierarchy."
